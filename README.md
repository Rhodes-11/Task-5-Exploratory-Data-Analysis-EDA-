# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 🔍 Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to discover trends, patterns, and correlations between features and survival outcome.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Files Included
- `train.csv` – Titanic dataset
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook with all analysis steps
- `findings.pdf` – Summary of results and visualizations (to be added)
- `eda_summary.txt` – Raw text output from `.info()`, `.describe()` and missing value checks
- `plot_*.png` – Visualizations (age distribution, survival count, etc.)

## 🔎 Key Findings
- Age distribution is skewed toward younger passengers.
- Women and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
- Fare and class show positive correlation with survival.
- Missing data is significant in `Cabin`.
